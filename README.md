Collaborative notes
- Lucky.py = simplest form of script, if SLAM can squeeze in between shelf's legs, just add Jack actuator script.
- GUI.py = tkinter interface done by Tycoon, not usable yet (lack compatability).
- sub.py = subscriber node code from in-class lab
- moveto4goals.py = coordinate movements code from in-class lab
